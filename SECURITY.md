# Security Policy for BD Income Tax Calculator

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously in the **BD Income Tax Calculator** project. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow the steps below:

1. **Do Not Open a Public Issue**: To avoid misuse, do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly via issues.

2. **Contact Us Privately**: Email a detailed report to [contact@anichur.com](mailto:contact@anichur.com) including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Affected components
   - Suggested remediation (if any)

3. **Response Time**: We typically respond within **2-5 business days**.

4. **Disclosure Coordination**: We will coordinate disclosure once a fix is available.

## Best Practices

Even though this is a frontend-only app, we suggest:
- Always use the latest version
- Verify the source and authenticity before using any clone
- Do not rely solely on the calculator for legal/tax filing decisions

Thank you for helping keep the project secure.
